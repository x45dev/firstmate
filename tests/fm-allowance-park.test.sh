# tests/fm-allowance-park.test.sh - detection of a worker parked on the ACCOUNT
# allowance (bin/fm-allowance-lib.sh) and the two callers that act on it:
# bin/fm-watch.sh, which must surface the park as a named wake, and
# bin/fm-crew-state.sh, which must report it as the crew's current state.
#
# The defect these pin: a refused turn leaves the process alive, the endpoint
# alive, and the pane rendering normally, so every liveness probe firstmate owns
# reads healthy and nothing fires. On 2026-08-17 two crewmates parked seconds
# after launch and were found hours after their reset had already passed, by a
# wedge alarm that had nothing to do with the cause.
#
# The verdict is harness-dependent - both signals come from something the vendor
# emits - so this portable half pins the classifier logic with no harness
# installed, and the opt-in live half in
# tests/fm-allowance-park-live-e2e.test.sh proves the transcript store is still
# where firstmate looks for a REAL worker. Neither replaces the other: a stub can
# only confirm the assumption already written into the stub, and a live guard
# cannot run in CI.
#
# Both signals are driven apart deliberately in the cases below, because a
# two-signal check whose signals are never separated is indistinguishable from a
# one-signal check: each case that asserts the verdict survives losing a signal
# first asserts that the signal really is absent.
