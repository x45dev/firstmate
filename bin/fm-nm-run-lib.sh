# ONE owner for the no-mistakes run-attribution primitives used by
# fm-crew-state.sh (read-only current-state reporting) and fm-teardown.sh
# (pre-teardown run abort, see its "Fix 1" header comment). Both bind a run
# by strict branch-and-head identity first, and both then recognize a provable
# pipeline-owned continuation through fm_nm_runs_status_for_worktree below:
# crew-state for an ACTIVE run, so a fix round never reads as an older failed
# run, and teardown for a run PARKED at a gate, so cleanup concludes it
# instead of orphaning it. Getting this wrong in either
# direction is unsafe: a false negative hides a genuinely parked run, and a
# false positive lets teardown act on a run it does not own.

#     (local work advanced outside the run, or the branch tip was rewritten)

# recognition for that case, and fm_nm_run_is_pipeline_owned_active below
# carries the custody exemption: a live run whose pipeline currently owns the
# branch binds without head equality.
#
# This predicate binds one run at a time, and MORE THAN ONE recorded run can
# bind to the same worktree at once: a run that died at the worktree's exact
# commit still binds by the equal-commit rule while its live successor binds by
# the ancestor rule (observed 2026-08: a crashed validation daemon left a failed
# run at the worktree's own commit while the live run that replaced it validated
# a descendant commit on the same branch).
# When several runs bind, a LIVE run always outranks a terminal one, whichever
# match rule each one used, because a terminal run can be the corpse of a
# crashed attempt while the live one is what is actually validating this code.
# Within one liveness class the selecting caller's existing precedence is
# unchanged - for the runs ledger, fm_nm_runs_status_for_worktree's
# newest-row-decides rule below.
# fm_nm_run_status_class next classifies a recorded status word for that

# "<status> <branch> <short-sha> <date> [<pr-url>]"; the `axi` surface has no
# runs-listing subcommand - verified against the installed CLI). Prints the
# status word of the branch's CURRENT run row, or nothing when the ledger
# cannot prove attribution. When optional expected head $4 is supplied, its
# abbreviated commit identity must match the newest row. The branch's NEWEST
# row alone decides; older rows are history and never answer for the present:
#   - newest row's head resolves and matches the worktree (fm_nm_head_matches_worktree):
#     its status word
#   - newest row's head resolves but does not match: nothing (a newer run that
#     is not this worktree's makes every older row stale history)
#   - newest row's head does not resolve in this copy (the pipeline committed
#     its fix round in its own checkout and the task copy never fetched it):
#     recognized ONLY as a provable pipeline-owned continuation of the
#     submitted head, which requires ALL of: the row is ACTIVE (status
#     running), and the immediately older row for the SAME branch resolves to
#     EXACTLY the worktree HEAD. The pipeline's own ledger then proves an
#     unbroken run sequence from a run that ended at the submitted head to an
#     active run on the same branch - the anchored active row's status word is
#     printed. Anything else (no anchor row, an anchor that is merely an
#     ancestor, a terminal unresolvable row) prints nothing, so branch-name
#     coincidence, arbitrary remote state, and other tasks' runs never match.
# The one exception to newest-row-decides is the live-over-terminal rule stated
# with fm_nm_head_matches_worktree above, and it only ever replaces a TERMINAL
# answer with a LIVE one: when the newest row binds but is terminal, the older
# rows are scanned for a live row that ALSO binds to this worktree, and that
# row's status word is printed instead. A live row whose head resolves in this
# copy binds by fm_nm_head_matches_worktree. A live row whose head does NOT
# resolve (the routine shape: the pipeline's fix-round commits live only in the
# gate repo) binds ONLY when the held terminal row sits at EXACTLY the worktree
# HEAD - the same exact-equality anchor the pipeline-continuation rule above
# requires, so branch-name coincidence and other tasks' runs still never
# match. A terminal newest row is the corpse of a crashed attempt whenever a
# live run for the same worktree is still on the ledger, so it is not the
# present. Nothing else widens: a newest row that does not bind still ends the
# scan, a newest row whose class is live or unclassifiable is still answered
# as-is, the anchored pipeline-continuation path is untouched, and with no live
# sibling the newest terminal word is still what is printed.
