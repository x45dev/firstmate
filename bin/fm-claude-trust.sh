# Pre-register Claude Code's workspace trust for the directory a claude spawn is
# about to launch into - the isolated task worktree of a ship or scout crewmate,
# or the seeded home of a secondmate - so the agent reaches its brief or charter
# instead of wedging on the trust dialog.
#
# Usage: fm-claude-trust.sh <worktree> <project>
#        fm-claude-trust.sh --secondmate-home <home> <id>
#   <worktree>  the isolated task worktree this spawn launches into
#   <project>   the primary checkout that worktree belongs to
#   <home>      the seeded secondmate home this spawn launches into
#   <id>        the secondmate id that home must already be marked for
# Prints one line naming what it registered; refuses loudly on anything else.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Claude Code gates a folder it has never seen behind an
# interactive workspace-trust dialog, and --dangerously-skip-permissions does
# NOT cover it: `claude --help` records that the dialog is skipped only in
# non-interactive mode (-p, or a non-TTY stdout), and a spawned pane is
# interactive. Every fresh task worktree therefore hits it, and so does every
# secondmate home the operator has not opened by hand. The dialog renders
# with the cursor on "No, exit" and firstmate's steering plane carries only
# Enter, Escape and C-c with no arrow navigation, so firstmate cannot answer it
# and must not try - pressing Enter would select exit. The agent wedges before
# it ever reads the brief. Registering the trust before launch is the only
# control that reaches an interactive pane.
#
# THE SCOPE TEST IS THE SAFETY PROPERTY, and it is STRUCTURAL rather than a
# path policy. Each mode has its own, because the two directories have entirely
# different shapes on disk.
#
# WORKTREE MODE. <worktree> must be a LINKED git worktree - its own git dir,
# sharing <project>'s common dir - whose top level is exactly the resolved
# argument. Git is the ground truth, so the argument is never trusted on its
# own word: a primary checkout (git dir == common dir), a worktree of an
# unrelated repo, a subdirectory of a worktree, a plain directory, and a home
# directory are each refused. Refusal is a non-zero exit, never a warning and
# never a silent skip.
#
# The test is deliberately NOT a treehouse or orca path prefix. Treehouse's
# root is configurable (--root, TREEHOUSE_ROOT, config, and a relative
# in-project pool), so a prefix check would refuse legitimate roots, accept
# whatever a mutable env var names, and add exactly the policy surface this
# registration must not grow. The structural test is verified for treehouse
# worktrees, which are linked git worktrees. Orca's worktree shape is UNVERIFIED:
# docs/orca-backend.md calls it an "independent worktree", which does not
# establish a shared git common dir, and orca is macOS-only and was not installed
# where this was written. If Orca clones instead of linking, its git dir equals
# its common dir, so this refuses it as a primary checkout and an orca claude
# spawn fails loudly here rather than wedging on the dialog later. fm-spawn.sh's
# own validate_spawn_worktree would not catch that case first: it compares the
# worktree root against the primary and never compares common dirs, so an
# independent clone passes it. Close this on a box that has Orca through the live
# opt-in guard family (FM_*_LIVE_E2E=1) and record the result in
# docs/verification/runtime-backends.md, rather than assuming the shape here.
#
# SECONDMATE-HOME MODE. A secondmate home is a whole firstmate instance rather
# than a task worktree, and bin/fm-home-seed.sh produces it in two shapes: a
# leased treehouse worktree (linked) and a standalone clone of the firstmate
# repo (a primary checkout). The worktree test above therefore cannot decide
# this case at all - it refuses the standalone clone as a primary checkout,
# which is why a claude secondmate in an explicit ~/fm-homes/<id> home met the
# dialog with nothing registered. Git shape is not the evidence here; THE SEED
# IS. The home must carry a .fm-secondmate-home marker that is a regular file
# this user owns, never a symlink, naming exactly the <id> passed; it must hold
# the firstmate instance files AGENTS.md and bin/; and each of its data, state,
# config and projects paths must resolve inside the home. That is the set
# bin/fm-home-seed.sh writes and bin/fm-spawn.sh's validate_firstmate_home_for_spawn
# re-checks before launch, so this accepts exactly the homes a secondmate spawn
# will launch into and nothing wider: a plain directory, a project checkout, an
# ordinary firstmate checkout, a home marked for a different secondmate, and a
# home whose operational directory escapes it are each refused. An ABSENT
# operational directory is accepted for the same reason the spawn accepts one -
# a test stricter than the spawn's own would move the wedge from the dialog to
# a refusal without making any unseeded directory less trusted.
#
# Home-level trust is broader than worktree trust, since the pane starts in the
# home and the secondmate works across it, so it is granted on that seed
# evidence alone and never on a caller's word about what a path is.
#
# Only the launching user's own store is written: the projects entry for the
# registered path in ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME}/.claude.json, which must be a
# regular file this uid owns. Every unrelated key and project entry is
# preserved, and the replacement is atomic. fm-spawn.sh forwards CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR
# onto the claude launch verbatim rather than resolving it, and the pane starts
# in the registered directory, so only an absolute value names the same store on
# both sides; a relative one is refused below rather than guessed at.
set -u
# Path resolution here must answer from the filesystem, never from the caller's
# environment, because the refusals below are the safety property. CDPATH would
# redirect any relative `cd` operand - notably the `.git` that
# `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` returns for a primary checkout - into an
# unrelated directory. The git overrides do the same to git's own answers: an
# inherited GIT_DIR with GIT_WORK_TREE makes a primary checkout report a linked
# worktree's git dir, so the primary-checkout refusal would pass. Git exports
# GIT_DIR into every hook environment, so an inherited value is ordinary rather
# than hostile. Clear the whole class once here so every subshell inherits it
# and a later added git call cannot silently reintroduce the hole.
