# Establish that a pull request's change was actually validated by repository
# suites, and refuse every outcome that only looks like it was.
# This is the check to run before reporting a pull request green, and the reason
# an all-green check LIST is never enough on its own: bin/fm-ci-checks-lib.sh
# owns why, and owns the classification itself.
#
# Two places can hold that evidence, and this script reads both in order:
#
#   1. The pull request's own checks, in the repository it targets. When those
#      include this repository's suites and everything passed, that is the
#      answer and nothing else is consulted.
#   2. Failing that, the head repository - your fork - at the same commit.
#      GitHub holds a fork contributor's upstream workflow runs until a
#      maintainer approves them, so an unapproved pull request routinely carries
#      no upstream suite at all. The fork ran them on the branch push, and that
#      run is real validation of the same commit. Accepting it is what makes an
#      upstream approval a contribution question rather than a validation one.
#      That acceptance is granted on the run's JOBS, never on the run's own
#      conclusion: a run concludes success whenever nothing in it failed, which
#      a run whose jobs were skipped or never expanded also does, so only the
#      required suite roster appearing green among those jobs is evidence.
#
# A commit validated only in the fork is reported as exactly that, naming the
# repository and run, so a green verdict always says where its evidence came
# from and is never confused with the upstream pull request having been checked.
#
# The standard a green verdict is held to - which workflows gate the repository
# and which suites they must report - belongs to the repository the pull request
# targets, and is resolved from it for every run of this script. See
# fm_ci_roster in bin/fm-ci-checks-lib.sh, which owns where both halves come
# from and why. This script is asked about any repository the fleet works in, so
# it names neither half itself: a repository whose gate or roster cannot be
# established is refused rather than judged against another repository's, and a
# repository whose gating workflow is not called "CI" is answered rather than
# discarded.
#
# Usage: fm-pr-ci-verify.sh <pr-url>
# Env:   FM_CI_GATING_WORKFLOWS  JSON array of workflow names to treat as the
#          repository's gate instead of the ones read from its own successful
#          push runs on the target branch. The escape hatch for a repository
#          that rule gets wrong.
#        FM_CI_REQUIRED_SUITES  JSON array of job names to require instead of
#          the roster read from the target repository. The escape hatch for a
#          change that deliberately adds or removes a CI job, whose branch is
#          therefore judged against a roster the target branch has not
#          recorded yet.
# Exit:  0 repository suites ran and passed, upstream or in the head repository
#        1 they did not: none ran, one is red, one has not finished, or fewer
#          than the full required roster reported
